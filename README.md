## Background and Purpose

This study aimed to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus other current treatment regimens. Data analysis consists of cleaning and merging datasets to generate appropriate tables and figures essential to present a statistically sound report. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through various drug regimens currently on the market. Over 45 days, tumor development, measured in tumor volume (mm), was observed and measured to assess Capomulin's efficacy. 


## Results

The correlation between weight and average tumor volume is 0.84, and the r-squared linear regression is 0.71. Although it is typically better to look at adjusted R-squared rather than R-squared and at the standard error of the regression rather than the standard deviation of the errors, there appears to be a positive correlation between weight and average tumor volume. Thus, weight gain or higher weight is associated with higher average tumor volume. Furthermore, the average tumor volume in mice subjects taking Capomulin was lower than the other drugs administered.
